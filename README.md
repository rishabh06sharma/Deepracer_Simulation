In this project I utilised [aws-robomaker-sample-application-deepracer](https://github.com/amazon-archives/aws-robomaker-sample-application-deepracer) repository to train and deploy the deep learning model in the aws-robomaker simulated environment. Aws-robomaker-sample-application-deepracer repository was only used to utilize tracks  and car model as a platform to make it autonomus using deep learning. This package provides a car with a front facing camera and control(steering and acceleration) through four wheel. Because this package provides the simulation environment in gazebo, it makes alot easier to aquire data using ROSbag.
